Project Title:
File Management System

Project Overview
Our application is a File Management System (DMS) designed to help offices organize, store, and manage documents efficiently. Many organizations struggle to find PDFs and CSV files quickly, often wasting time searching through unorganized folders. This application provides a centralized platform where users can upload, categorize by office/department, search, view, and export documents easily.

The main users are office employees, managers, and administrative staff who need fast access to important files. Admins can manage documents, monitor uploads, and manage office or department categories. By organizing files by office, the system makes it easier to locate documents, streamlines workflows, and reduces wasted time.
This system is valuable because it focuses on office-specific document management, supporting both PDFs and CSVs. Users benefit from structured storage, search filters, office categorization, and secure access, making daily operations more efficient and organized.
